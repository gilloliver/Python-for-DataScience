1. Sample
- Sample mean is nearly population mean
- Standard deviation of sample is population std / sqrt(number of sample) -> more sample better estimation
2. Confidence Interval
 - Confidence Interval (95%) does not tell you "the probability of true value falls into the interval" but tell you "if we repeat the sampling to get Confidence interval, 95% of intervals will cover true value"
